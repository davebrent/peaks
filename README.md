# Peaks

Peaks is a (work in progress) tool for rendering 3d maps.

## TODO

* [ ] Ray bilinear patch intersection for terrain
* [ ] Better sub sampling method (Poisson disc...)
* [ ] Orthographic camera
* [ ] Use simulated film values for setting field of view
* [ ] Adding water bodies (possibly from shp file?)
* [ ] Add a line string primitive for drawing paths
* [ ] Add marker primitives
* [ ] Terrain pre-processing raster operations (feature preserving smoothing)
* [ ] Non photo realistic features outlines on the terrain
* [ ] Documentation
    * [ ] Coordinate systems
    * [ ] Linear color
